# User Stories #

#### I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
    - title 
    - url 
    - description
    - rating(1-5)

#### I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
    - All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

#### I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
    - Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

#### I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

#### I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
    - Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

#### I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
